# Arduino-Uno-wifi-Contest

  My idea for the Arduino Uno Wifi project would be to use the Arduino kit as microcontroller for doing physics experiment projects. I would mount the Uno Wifi to an Arduino Robot Car, and attach senosors that detect motion, speed, temperature, and light. Then I will create an app( probably in Processing) to control the robot car and deliver the data from the senors to the app on a smartphone via wifi. For an car collision experiment to find relationships of momentum and impulse, I can use the phone to control the speed of the robot car instead of using a physical spring to start the car. This Arduino Uno Wifi will help to collect much more accurate datas for the lab, and easily collect datas for writing lab report. Also it will be easier to create a demonstration/ visual representation of the lab. The Arduino kit can be reassemeble to fit in other differnt physics experiments, such as light ray refraction lab using the light detecting sensor and pressure lab with a temperature sensor.
Thank you for reading.
